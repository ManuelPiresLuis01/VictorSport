### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

## Running the Development Server

To run the development server with hot module replacement (HMR):

```bash

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build of your project in the `dist` folder.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Runs the development server.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code issues.
